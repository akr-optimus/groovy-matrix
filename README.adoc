= groovy-matrix
A simple Matrix utility written in Groovy, enhanced with GPars

== Description

groovy-matrix is a simple groovy utility to do Matrix operations (currently just multiplication and addition). This has 
been implemented in groovy and GPars.

== Usage

[source, groovy]
....
Matrix m  = new Matrix(2, 2)
m.addRow([1, 1])
m.addRow([1, 1])

Matrix n  = new Matrix(2, 2)
n.addRow([1, 1])
n.addRow([1, 1])

Matrix r = m * n
Matrix s = m + n
....

== TODO

I am planning to add more operations like determinant, eigen values etc. to this module.
